<h1>Windows Defender Firewall</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Windows Defender Firewall is a type of firewall that works on the device itself. It adds security by letting you make rules that decide which network traffic can come into the device and which network traffic the device can send out to the network.
<br/>
<br/>
The Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security is like a supercharged version that can do more than the simple Windows Defender Firewall in the Control Panel. Even though both use the same basic parts, they let you control things in different manners. The Control Panel one is okay if you're just guarding a device at home, but it's not strong enough for larger networks like businesses have. Those situations need tougher tools to handle and protect the complicated network activity.
<br/>
<br/>
In this project, I walk through how to set up rules for the firewall using both Windows Defender Firewall and Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
<br/> 
<br/>
I focus on two objectives:
